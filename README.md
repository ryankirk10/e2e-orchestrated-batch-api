# End-to-End (e2e) Batch API Pipeline

Repo started using template **[`in this post`](https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/data-engineering-projects-with-free-template/)** to reduce effort required to stand all services up and allow more efficient learning of principles around:
- API
- AWS
    - EC2
    - EMR
    - S3
- Docker
- Airflow
- Terraform (IaC)
- Github Workflows
- CI/CD

## Objective

Deploy system that will get data from API on a scheduled cadence, ingest, store, model, transform, and visualize this data using cloud-based systems.
